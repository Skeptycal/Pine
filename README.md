Pine: Python Neural Networks
---
["Python Neural Networks" -> "PyNN" -> "Pine"]
#### A simple ANN library written entirely in vanilla Python 3

This has been a fun project that's been written while learning about neural nets
and machine learning in general.  It's also being used for research in
Emergency Medicine.

## Requirements
Python3 installed (and accessible at '/usr/bin/env python3')

## Library
View the pine/ directory -> everything should be pretty well documented

## Command line script
Use './bin/pineCLI.py' (add '-h' for help)

##### Install Shell Command:
To access pineCLI.py globally, run './installShellCommand.py'.  This will
install 'pine' to /usr/local/bin/ as a soft link, allowing bin/pineCLI.py to be
run as 'pine' from any directory, assuming /usr/local/bin/ is on your path.

## Demo
Use './demo/demo.py' for a quick, old demo.  Also, the bottom of demo.py
can be edited to run other sample demo projects.

## Workflow
Checkout the 'Pine Data Tools' repo (https://github.com/dusenberrymw/Pine-Data-Tools)
for a sample workflow for running real projects.  Be sure to install the shell command first, as seen above.
