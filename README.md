Pine: Python Neural Networks
---
["Python Neural Networks" -> "PyNN" -> "Pine"]
#### A simple ANN library written entirely in vanilla Python 3

This has been a fun project that's been written while learning about neural nets
and machine learning in general.

## Requirements
Python3 installed (and accessible at '/usr/bin/env python3')

## Library
See pine/ folder

## Command line script
Use './bin/pineCLI.py' (add '-h' for help)

## Demo
Use './demo/demo.py' for a quick, old demo.  Also, the bottom of demo.py
can be edited to run other sample demo projects.

## Workflow
Checkout the 'Pine Data Tools' repo for a sample workflow for running real
projects.
